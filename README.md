# Image-mosaicing-with-cylidrical-mapping

The concept and every step are explained in details in the attched word file and in comments in the matlab code itself.

For the final project, Vl_sift was used to get the features and descriptors of the image instead of the features function  attached. 

To run the program, first, go to vlfeat/tollbox and run vl_setup. Then return back and run the main panorama code.
